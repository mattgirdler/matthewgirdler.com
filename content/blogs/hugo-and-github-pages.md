In the absence of inspiration, I thought what better way to christen this new blog than to explain how I made it!

## Background

I'll start off by talking a bit about why I created this blog, and why I chose Hugo with GitHub Pages. If that's not of interest to you, you can skip ahead to the main content.

### Domain
I've had this domain since 2009, when it was bought for me by a family member. I didn't know what to do with it at the time, and didn't really think about it until last year when the ownership was transferred over to me. 
This seemed like as good an excuse as any to try and tick off two tasks that had been on my personal backlog for a while:
- create a living CV (I hate dealing with Word docs) 
- start blogging

### Hugo
I came across Hugo during a work project, while investigating a static site generator that could replace a WordPress website. I considered a few different options, including Jekyll and Gatsby, but Hugo seemed to be the most fuss-free of the bunch. 
It also has a number of options for exporting from WordPress, as well as some neat add ons like Netlify CMS for a tidy admin interface with a rich text editor - because most people really don't want to deal with markdown. 

### GitHub Pages

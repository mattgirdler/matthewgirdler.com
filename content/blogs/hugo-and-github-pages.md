In the absence of other ideas, what better way to christen a new blog than to explain how I made it. 

## Background

I'll start off by talking a bit about why I created this blog, and why I chose Hugo with GitHub Pages. If that's not of interest to you, you can skip ahead to the main content.

I've had this domain since 2009, when it was bought for me by my uncle. I didn't really know what to do with it, and as a result I did nothing with it until about 

I came across Hugo while investigating a static site generator that could replace a WordPress website. 
As it turns out, Hugo has a number of options for exporting from WordPress, as well as some neat add ons like Netlify CMS for a tidy admin interface with a rich text editor.
